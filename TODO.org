* Questions
  
* Alpha (Demoable/guided)
  * Space branding of main app - contentious
  * Invoice details page (design coming...).
  * Member portal design changes (design coming?)

* Beta (5-10 early adopters)
  * Add description back in for invoices - perhaps called summary
  * Consistency issues with forms (post create/update redirects)
  * Make use of timezone?
  * Scheduled invoices (subsciptions auto generate)
  * Scheduled payments (auto payment for subscriptions)
    * Email payment receipts - Mailer done, will call when doing subscription payments
    * Perhaps it should still send the email when adding any kind of payment?!?
  * Onboarding, take to new member invoice with plan and prefil invoice.

* 2.0 (MVP, ship in January-february time frame, available to all, for money)
  * Delete invoice links (Same)
  * Improve display of errors on fields for devise forms.
  * Add "due in" to issue date column on invoice list?
  * Space Branding for member portal
  * Change member password
  * Member password recovery
    * Can also/do instead password reset on admin site (would resend invite basically)
  * Add evil icons (rails plugin, etc) or are we going to use pngs generated from AI file?
    * Looks like they're making a pass to add more icons!  Could get full set of needed very soon.

* 2.1

* 2.2

* Backlog
  * Events/Notifcations (Activity Tab in New navigation)
  * Maybe add Tags to members to allow arbitrary groupings
  * Add 'Social' Signup/Login for Member portal (FB, Twitter, G+)?
  * Add team support

  * Add Paid and Remaining columns to Member account history.

  * Attendance tracking (check in, out)
  * Attendance tracking API (remote systems updating)
  * Attendance tracking self checking kiosk mode (use attendance tracking api?)
  * Attendance analytics

  * Vanity analytics (# members, etc - probably 'built-in' to each screen)

  * Punch cards

  * Braintree payment gateway
  * Paypal payments (offsite)

  * API Server side
    * Api authentication
    * Api implementation (Per space)
      * members
      * billing
      * member auth
  * API Client side (restful, ruby, golang? python?, etc?)
